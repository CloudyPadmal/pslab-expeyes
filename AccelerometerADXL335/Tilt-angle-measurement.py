'''
Accelerometer ADXL 335 can be used for measuring Tilt angle
ADXL335 acceleration measurement range is +/- 3 g. Supply voltage is 1.8 â€“  3.6 V, however all specifications at the datasheet is given at 3.0 V. This accelerometer has  3 outputs for X,Y,Z axis which voltage is proportional to acceleration on specific axis.

At midpoint when acceleration is 0 g output is typically 1/2 of supply voltage. If a supply voltage is 3V, then output is 1.5 V. Output sensitivity typically is 300 mV/g.
