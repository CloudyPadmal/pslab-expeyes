####Accelerometer Sensor ADXL-335

An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration ("g-force"). Proper acceleration is not the same as coordinate acceleration (rate of change of velocity). For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration g= 9.81 m/s2 straight upwards. By contrast, accelerometers in free fall orbiting and accelerating due to the gravity of Earth will measure zero.

**ADXL 335-GY-61** is a small, thin, low power, complete three-axis accelerometer voltage output through the signal conditioning at a minimum of full scale Â± 3 g measurement range acceleration. It can measure the  acceleration of gravity, and movement, shock or vibration due to dynamic acceleration.
