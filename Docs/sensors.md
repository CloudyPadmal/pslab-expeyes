####Accelerometer Sensor :  ADXL-335

An accelerometer is a device that measures proper acceleration ("g-force"). Proper acceleration is not the same as coordinate acceleration (rate of change of velocity). For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration g= 9.81 m/s2 straight upwards. By contrast, accelerometers in free fall orbiting and accelerating due to the gravity of Earth will measure zero.

**ADXL 335-GY-61** is a small, thin, low power, complete three-axis accelerometer voltage output through the signal conditioning at a minimum of full scale ± 3 g measurement range acceleration. It can measure the  acceleration of gravity,and movement, shock or vibration due to dynamic acceleration.


####Relative Humidity Sensor : HS-1101

Relative humidity is an important metric used in weather forecasts and reports, as it is an indicator of the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. In hot summer weather, a rise in relative humidity increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin. Ref: wikipedia.org


**HS1101 sensor** consists of a capacitor which varies with relative humidity and is used in a 555 circuit to generate a pulse train of frequency related to relative humidity. The number of pulses over a one second period are counted and the RH is then calculated.

Based on a unique capacitive cell, this relative humidity sensor is designed for high volume, cost sensitive applications such as office automation, automotive cabin air control, home appliances, and industrial process control systems. They are also useful in all applications where humidity compensation is needed.

####Temeprature Sensors : LM-35 and PT-100

Platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) offer excellent accuracy over a wide temperature range (from –200 to +850 °C). Standard sensors are are available from many manufacturers with various accuracy specifications and numerous packaging options to suit most applications. Unlike thermocouples, it is not necessary to use special cables to connect to the sensor. 

For **LM-35**  temperature sensor the output voltage is linearly proportional to the Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. LM35 does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±1⁄4̊ C  at room temperature and ±3⁄4̊C over a full −55 to +150 ̊C temperature range.  Another temperature sensor PT100 is previously  tested with ExpEYES.  It offers excellent accuracy over a wide temperature range (from –200 to +850 °C). 

The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature sensors, whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. The LM35 thus has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in ̊ Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from its output to obtain convenient Centi- grade scaling. 

####Hall Magnetic Sensor : Hall Sensor -3144 and Module KY-003

Exploring  the use of this magnetic sensor for measuring rotational speed of anemometer and other measurements was quiet interesting experience.  Tried Hall sensor 3144 and KY-003 module.

The KY-003 is a magnetic switch. If no magnetic field is present, the signal line of the sensor is HIGH (3.5 V). If a magnetic field is presented to the sensor, the signal line goes LOW, at the same time the LED on the sensor lights up. The polarity of the magnetic field is of influence to the switching action. The front side of the sensor needs the opposite polarity as the back of the sensor to switch on.
