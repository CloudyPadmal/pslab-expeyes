This Repository is intended for hosting programs to conduct science experiments using Free Software and Open Hardware frameworks like ExpEYES (www.expeyes.in), MicroHope (www.microhope.org) and other open source tools. It is also intended to host documentation related to designing computer interfaced science experiments using low-cost sensors and home-made apparatus.
