This Repository is intended for hosting programs to conduct science experiments using Free Software and Open Hardware frameworks like ExpEYES (www.expeyes.in) and MicroHope (www.microhope.org). It is also intended to host documentation related to designing computer interfaced science experiments using low-cost sensors and home-made apparatus.
