#### 3-axes Magnetic Field Sensor Module GY-271

The Compass Module is designed for low-field magnetic sensing with a digital interface, to provide heading information for your microcontroller project.

This compact sensor fits into small projects such as UAVs and robot navigation systems. The sensor converts any magnetic field to a differential voltage output on 3 axes. This voltage shift is the raw digital output value, 
which can then be used to calculate headings or sense magnetic fields coming from different directions.
