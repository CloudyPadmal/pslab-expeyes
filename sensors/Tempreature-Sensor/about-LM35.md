# Temperature Sensor LM-35

The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature
sensors, whose output voltage is linearly proportional to the
Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. The LM35 thus has an
advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in
̊ Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large
constant voltage from its output to obtain convenient Centi-
grade scaling. The LM35 does not require any external
calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of
±1⁄4̊ Cat room temperature and ±3⁄4̊C over a full −55 to +150 ̊C
temperature range. Low cost is assured by trimming and
calibration at the wafer level. The LM35’s low output imped-
ance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration make
interfacing to readout or control circuitry especially easy. It
can be used with single power supplies, or with plus and
minus supplies. As it draws only 60 μA from its supply, it has
very low self-heating, less than 0.1 ̊C in still air. The LM35 is
rated to operate over a −55 ̊ to +150 ̊C temperature range,
while the LM35C is rated for a −40 ̊ to +110 ̊C range (−10 ̊
with improved accuracy). The LM35 series is available pack-
aged in hermetic TO-46 transistor packages, while the
LM35C, LM35CA, and LM35D are also available in the
plastic TO-92 transistor package. The LM35D is also avail-
able in an 8-lead surface mount small outline package and a
plastic TO-220 package
