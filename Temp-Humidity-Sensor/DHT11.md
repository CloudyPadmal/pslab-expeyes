##DHT11 Temperature Humidity Sensor Module 
 
This sensor module includes resistive humidity sensing component and NTC temperature testing. 
 
Specification:

    Signal transmission range: 20m
    Humidity measuring range: 20 - 95% RH
    Humidity measurement error: + / -5%
    Temperature measurement range: 0 - 50°C
    Temperature measurement error: + / -2°C
    Operating voltage: 3.3 - 5V

The DHT11 is a basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). Its fairly simple to use, but requires careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds.
